# Four-device network-datasets-for-device-classification-in-SIoT


This repository provides four kinds of device2device attributed network datasets, specifically CLOR device2device network, MOR device2device network, OOR device2device network, and SOR device2device network.

In each network folder, there are three files, namely, the adjacency matrix of the network (e.g. MORdevicenet.mat), the attribute matrix of the devices (e.g. MORattributefeature.npy), and the label array of the device (e.g. MORdevicelabel.npy).

These datasets can be used to study the multi-classification of devices in the Internet of Things.
